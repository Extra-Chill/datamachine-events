/**
 * Ability Permissions Helper
 *
 * Shared permission callbacks for Data Machine Events abilities.
 *
 * Permission shape:
 *   1. WP-CLI is always allowed (matches the existing admin-tool
 *      convention used by GeocodingAbilities, SettingsAbilities,
 *      VenueStatsAbilities).
 *   2. The capability the user must hold for the operation is
 *      filterable so platform consumers can elevate trust beyond the
 *      defaults (e.g. grant `edit_others_posts`-class privileges to a
 *      non-editor role via a custom capability they map themselves).
 *
 * Filters:
 *   - `datamachine_events_write_capability` — default
 *     `edit_others_posts`. Platforms can return their own capability
 *     to widen the trust pool for write operations.
 *   - `datamachine_events_read_capability` — default `edit_posts`.
 *     Same shape for the (currently unused) diagnostic read gate.
 *
 * @package DataMachineEvents\Abilities
