/**
 * Event AI tool guard.
 *
 * Events pipelines are shaped `event_import → ai → upsert` where the upsert
 * handler is `upsert_event` (creates `data_machine_events` posts). The AI step
 * is the only place the model can decide to publish — and it is supposed to
 * reach ONLY the events upsert tool plus the fetch disposition tools
 * (`reject_source` / `defer_item`) and read/research tools.
 *
 * Data Machine core, however, exposes generic content-publishing ability tools
 * (`upsert_post`, `insert_content`) to EVERY pipeline AI step by default: they
 * declare `modes` including `pipeline`, and `ToolPolicyResolver` only narrows
 * the set when a step carries an explicit `enabled_tools` allow-list. Events
 * flows were seeded with `enabled_tools: []` (no allow-list), so the events AI
 * agent could reach past `upsert_event` and publish plain `post`-type junk
 * ("rejection reports", "admin logs") outside the event post type.
 *
 * Events pipelines are hand-built in the DM UI and stored as flow_config data;
 * this plugin does not seed them programmatically, so a code default for new
 * flows could not retroactively protect the existing flow rows. Instead this
 * guard hooks DM core's `datamachine_resolved_tools` filter and strips the
 * generic content-writing tools whenever the AI step being resolved is
 * adjacent to an `upsert_event` upsert step. Detection keys off the events
 * handler shape (`upsert_event` in an adjacent step's `handler_slugs`), never
 * off hardcoded flow IDs, so it covers every existing events flow at resolution
 * time with no data migration.
 *
 * The durable fix — making generic publish tools opt-in in DM core — is tracked
 * separately in Extra-Chill/data-machine#2852. This is the events-layer
 * mitigation: it is generic within this layer and becomes a harmless
 * belt-and-suspenders once the core fix lands.
